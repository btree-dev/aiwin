# Lineage.ai

Lineage.ai empowers the Web3 and AI community by facilitating content and IP creation and data tracking

## The Problem

## Our Solution

We protect the rights of both content providers and data scientists

For content providers,
- Mint content and create correspond IP policies for model training.
- Check if a piece of content is used for a finetuned model minted on Lineage.ai.
- Get compensated when a piece of minted IP is licensed for model training.

For Data Scientist
- Browser through minted content, check corresponding IP policies, and license content.
- Track content used for training and make it verifiable on blokchain.
- Be content (model) providers and get compensated.
